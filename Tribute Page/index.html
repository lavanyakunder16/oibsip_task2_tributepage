                </video>
            </div>
            <div class="team_content">
                <p>One of Pichai's most famous quotes is "You have to be comfortable with the notion that in order to
                    build something great, you have to be focused and picky." This quote speaks to Pichai's philosophy
                    of focusing on a few key things and doing them exceptionally well. In order to truly innovate,
                    Pichai believes that you have to be willing to say no to many things and stay focused on your core
                    mission</p>
                <p>Pichai has also been inspired by his upbringing in India, where he witnessed firsthand the
                    transformative power of technology. In an interview with The New York Times, he spoke about how his
                    father, who worked as an electrical engineer for the British conglomerate GEC, would bring home
                    technology magazines and talk to him about the latest developments in the field. This early exposure
                    to technology inspired Pichai to pursue a career in the field himself.</p>
                <p>Throughout his career, Pichai has remained committed to his mission of using technology to make the
                    world a better place. He has spoken about the importance of building products that are accessible to
                    everyone, regardless of their background or economic status. Under his leadership, Google has
                    launched several initiatives aimed at bringing the benefits of technology to underserved
                    communities, such as its Digital Skills for Africa program.
